The GIA priors contained in GIA_priors.mat were produced based on 216 GIA model predictions produced by Drs. Jerry X. Mitrovica and Carling C. Hay.  Values contained here correspond only to the 211 United States East Coast target locations considered in Piecuch et al. (2018).  Readers interested in the full (gridded) global GIA model predictions should contact Dr. Jerry X. Mitrovica (jxm@eps.harvard.edu).
